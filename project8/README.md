## Challenges

### Challenge 1

> Use the techniques you learned in project 2 to draw a thin gray line around the buttons view, to make it stand out from the rest of the UI.

### Challenge 2

> If the user enters an incorrect guess, show an alert telling them they are wrong. You’ll need to extend the submitTapped() method so that if firstIndex(of:) failed to find the guess you show the alert.

### Challenge 3

> Try making the game also deduct points if the player makes an incorrect guess. Think about how you can move to the next level – we can’t use a simple division remainder on the player’s score any more, because they might have lost some points.
